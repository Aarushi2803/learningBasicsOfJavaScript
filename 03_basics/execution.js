// 3. Execution Phase
let var1 = 10;

// Call Stack
// JavaScript uses a call stack to keep track of execution contexts. When a function is called, a new execution context is pushed onto the stack. Once the function completes, its execution context is popped off.
// JavaScript Engine
// The JavaScript engine (like V8 for Chrome) parses and executes the code efficiently. It converts JavaScript into machine code that the computer can understand.
